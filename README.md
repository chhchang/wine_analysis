### Wine Quality Analysis

It may require extensive training and years of experience for winemakers to create quality wine. It is challenging for them to control the outcome across vintages as the quality of grapes and their juice vary in each given season. Besides sensory tasting, winemakers also monitor physicochemical attributes of each batches to control the winemaking process. The attempt in this project is to find out whether we can use simple analytical result to predict human sensory preference of the given wine. By doing so, winemakers can make more accurate prediction on the quality of their wine before the end of the winemaking process. 

The potential client for this analysis would be winemakers to wants to have more accurate control on producing each batches of wine. Instead of base solely on experience and estimation, the prediction model would form a clear picture of production blueprint to maximize the sensory quality from the beginning of fermentation.

The data consists of two datasets of red and white wines released from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The source of the data comes from P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis. Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009. 

In this project, the white wine dataset is divided randomly into training set with 3898 samples and 1000 test set samples saved for cross-validation. To start, a histogram would be used to see the distribution of quality scores. Linear regression would be conducted on the attribute variables to quality score to find correlated attributes to wine quality. With the regression analysis, potential clusters of wine attributes will be examined. Both R-square inspection and cross-validation would be carried out to validate the regression model.


My deliverables would be presented on my GitHub profile. It would mainly consists of three objects, a write up of the project, the data and codes, and a presentation deck. The paper would contain an abstract, introduction, description of the data, the results from the approaches to tackle the data, visualization of the data, and the analysis on the prediction model. The presentation deck would contain brief overview of the project and visuals on the problem solving and prediction model.
